# Introduction
Tproxy is a high scalable transparent TCP proxy.

# How to istall and run
1. run make inside the Tproxy directory.
2. In order to use the proxy one should setup the following iptables rule (as root)
 > iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -m tcp -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8110
3. we can also specify the traffic to be intercepetd. example http (port = 80)
 > iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8110
 > iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -m tcp --sport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8110
4. To remove the iptables rules
> iptables -t nat -Z
> iptables -t nat -F
5. For output traffic on the local machine:
> iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m owner ! --uid-owner root  -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8110

__"-m owner ! --uid-owner root" allows to exclude traffic generated by the proxy itself from interception. Obviously we can run the proxy with a specific uid and exclude that uid from interception__
